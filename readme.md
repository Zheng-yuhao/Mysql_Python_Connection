# A standardized way to connect mysql and python.

Environment : Python 3.8

Well, It's a simple and standardized code to make a connection with Mysql and Python.

You have to add the password parameter in the common.py if you want to use my code trying to establish a connection.

And again, It is just a simple way for learning.

```
start.py

core
 -src.py

db
 -common.py
 -models.py

interface
 -login_registration_interface.py

conf
 -settings.py
